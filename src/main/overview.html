Pantomime is a Java library for manipulating and storing MIME messages.
<p>
As an alternative to JavaMail it is

<ol>
<li>Easy to learn and convenient to use.
<li>Memory-efficient. Able to load messages of any size without exhausting
    memory.
<li>Robust. Better adapted to handle mish-mash of real world messages that
    often do not comply with RFC.
</ol>
