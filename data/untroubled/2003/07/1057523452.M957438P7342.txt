      <td width="70%" valign="top">My boyfriend went out of town a few weeks
        ago.&nbsp; I decided I would give him a gift for his travels.&nbsp; I
        didn't want him to cheat on me, so I took a bunch of <a href="http://www.stiffycash.com/join.php?site=legaltightgirls&resellerid=s-77399-ez&banner=blondet0703&email=bait-excelled@em.ca&noemail=1">dirty
        pictures</a> of myself and gave them to him.&nbsp; That way he had
        something to jerk off to when he was feeling a little horny.&nbsp; He
        said he used them every night and that he didn't call because he was so
        busy.&nbsp; But when he got home, I discovered them in his trash.&nbsp;
        He never even brought them!&nbsp; What was he doing out there? I decided
        to leave him sense he was a liar and an inconsiderate jerk.&nbsp; But I
        still do like the pics, so I decided to share them with you!&nbsp; Have
        a look, I put them on my friends website.&nbsp; I hope you enjoy them
        more then my stupid ex-boyfriend did!
